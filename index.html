                Hey everyone, so here you'll find a bit of information about myself.  Clearly you're interested, or maybe you've been forced to read this.  Either way...enjoy.

                While I'm a very personable individual, I have never been a morning person.  So it is probably in your best interest to not expect too much unless I've had a sufficient dose of coffee.
